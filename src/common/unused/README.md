# `src/common/unused/`

These files are not currently `include(...)`d by `src/Reseau.jl` and are therefore not part of the package at runtime.

They are kept as reference material for future parity work. If you re-enable any of this code, add focused tests first
and wire the files into the module include graph deliberately.
